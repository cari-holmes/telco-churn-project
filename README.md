#### Goals: Deliver a well-rounded analysis as to why customers are churning. Create multiple predictive models in which you will select you top performing model as your MVP, perform exploratory analysis and feature engineering. Summarize conclusions based on the explore and the models created.

To create your own predictive models, use the following .py files and use the functions necessary to run through the data.
- acquire.py 
- prepare.py 
- split_scale.py  
- feature_selection.py 

Specific Deliverables:

- jupyter notebook where your work takes place that will be delivered to others to read as a report.
- csv file that predicts churn for each customer
- acquire.py, prepare.py, model.py (you may decide to separate tasks into others, such as preprocessing.py or features.py)
- google slide summarizing your model
